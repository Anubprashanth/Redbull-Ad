This project showcases a humorous and minimalist 2D animated advertisement inspired by the signature style of Red Bull ads. The concept features astronaut Sunitha Williams stuck in space. She discovers a can of Red Bull, takes a sip, and gains glowing wings that enable her to fly back to Earth, embodying the tagline: "Red Bull gives you wings!"
